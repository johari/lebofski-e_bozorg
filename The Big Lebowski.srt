Pledging their love
to the ground

00:00:16,447 --> 00:00:19,149
راوی: در غرب دور عزیزی بود.
NARRATOR: Way out West
there was this fella.

4
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:21,585
عزیزی که می‌خوام داستانشو براتون بگم
Fella I wanna tell you about.


5
00:00:21,586 --> 00:00:25,121
عزیزی به اسم
جف لبوفسکی
Fella by the name
of Jeff Lebowski.

6
00:00:25,122 --> 00:00:28,825
اقلن این اسمی بود که پدر مادر عزیزش براش گذاشتن
£east that was the handle
that his loving parents
gave him.

7
00:00:28,826 --> 00:00:31,962
ولی خودش خیلی فاز اسمشو نداشت
But he never had
much use for it himself.

8
00:00:31,963 --> 00:00:36,099
این لبوفسکی،
به خودش می‌گفت «دوود»
This Lebowski,
he called himself the Dude.

9
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,235
حالا دود
Now Dude,

10
00:00:38,236 --> 00:00:42,005
تو شهر ما کسی اسم خودشو همچی چیزی نمی‌ذاره
that's a name no one would
self-apply where I come from.

11
00:00:42,006 --> 00:00:47,476
ولی حالا می‌بینم خیلی چیزا راجع به دود بود
که زیاد برای من مفهوم نبود
But then there was a lot about
the Dude that didn't make
a whole lot of sense to me,

12
00:00:47,477 --> 00:00:50,212
خیلی چیزام راجع‌به جایی که زندگی می‌کرد
and a lot about
where he lived likewise.

Drifting along with
the tumbling tumbleweeds

14
00:00:52,482 --> 00:00:54,150
ولی شایدم
NARRATOR: But then again,

15
00:00:54,151 --> 00:00:57,319
واسه همین بود که فاز اونجا رو انقد شدید داشتم
maybe that's why
I found the place
so darned interesting.

16
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,355
I know when night has gone

17
00:00:59,356 --> 00:01:02,324
That a new world's
born at dawn

18
00:01:02,325 --> 00:01:06,428
به لوس آنگلس می‌گن شهر فرشته‌ها
NARRATOR:
They call Los Angeles
the City of Angels.

19
00:01:06,429 --> 00:01:09,565
بنظرم خیلی هم اینطوریا نیست
I didn't find it to be that,
exactly.

20
00:01:09,566 --> 00:01:13,369
ولی قبول دارم یه سری آدمای خوبی اونجا هستن
But I'll allow there are
some nice folks there.

21
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:16,138
البته بگم من لندنم ندیدم
Course, I can't say
I seen London,

22
00:01:16,139 --> 00:01:18,474
فرانسه هم نرفتم
and I never been to France,

23
00:01:18,475 --> 00:01:23,579
بقول یارو گفتنی تاحالا ملکه رو تو لباس زیرش ندیدم..
and I ain't never seen no
queen in her damned undies,
as the fella says.

24
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,581
ولی یه چی بگم،
But I'll tell you what,

25
00:01:25,582 --> 00:01:30,953
بعد دیدن لس آنجلس و همین این قصه که می‌خوام شرحشو بدم
after seeing Los Angeles
and this here story
I'm about to unfold,

26
00:01:30,954 --> 00:01:33,889
نمی‌دونم، شاید بشه گفت یه چیزایی دیدم
well, I guess
I've seen something

27
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:38,160
به همون اندازه داغون که میشه تو اون شهرا دید
every bit as stupefying
as you can see in any of
those other places,

28
00:01:38,161 --> 00:01:40,396
و تو ادبیات انگلیسی هم
and in English, too.

29
00:01:40,397 --> 00:01:43,399
پس می‌تونم با یه لبخند رو صورتم بمیرم
So I can die with
a smile on my face

30
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,199
بی اینکه حس کنم خدای مهربان گولم زده
without feeling like
the good Lord gypped me.

31
00:01:47,203 --> 00:01:49,305
حالا این داستانی که می‌خوام بگم
Now, this here story
I'm about to unfold

32
00:01:49,306 --> 00:01:52,408
اوایل دهه‌ی ۹۰ اتفاق افتاد
took place back
in the early '9·s,

33
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:57,346
درست اولای درگیریمون با صدام و عراقیا
just about the time
of our conflict with
Saddam and the lraqis.

34
00:01:57,347 --> 00:02:01,015
فقط می‌گم که، گاهی اوقات یکی هست
I only mention it 'cause
sometimes there's a man...

35
00:02:01,016 --> 00:02:03,117
نمی‌گم قهرمان
I won't say a hero.

And I'm talking about
the Dude here.

00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:13,528
بعضی وقتا یکی هست
Sometimes there's a man...

40
00:02:13,529 --> 00:02:18,199
چی‌بگم، آدم مناسب زمان و مکان خودشه
Well, he's the man
for his time and place.

41
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,002
درست جا می‌گیره همونجا
He fits right in there.

42
00:02:21,003 --> 00:02:24,405
که اونم دود توی لوس آنجلسه
And that's the Dude
in Los Angeles.

43
00:02:25,541 --> 00:02:28,209
با اینکه تن لش هم هست
And even if he is a lazy man,

44
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:30,912
که دود قطعا هم همینطور بود
and the Dude was
most certainly that,

45
00:02:30,913 --> 00:02:34,749
احتمالا تن لش ترین در منطقه لوس آنجلس
quite possibly the laziest
in Los Angeles county,

46
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:38,618
که اونو در صدر تن لشای جهان قرار می‌ده
which would place him
high in the running
for laziest worldwide.

47
00:02:39,855 --> 00:02:42,757

00:07:29,974 --> 00:07:31,675
این یه شئ قیمتی..
This was
a valued...

137
00:07:31,676 --> 00:07:33,544
چی به اتاق انسجام می‌داد دود؟
قالیم
What tied the room
together, Dude?
My rug.

138
00:07:33,545 --> 00:07:35,112
داشتی به داستان دود گوش می‌دادی تو، دانی؟
Were you listening
to the Dude's story,
Donny?

139
00:07:35,113 --> 00:07:36,280
چی؟
والتر.
What?
Walter.

140
00:07:36,281 --> 00:07:39,082
داشتی داستان دودو گوش می‌دادی آیا؟
داشتم توپ می‌نداختم
Were you listening
to the Dude's story?
I was bowling.

141
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:41,418
پس هیچ ایده‌ای از بحث نداری، دانی.
So you have no frame of
reference here, Donny.

142
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:44,354
عین بچه‌ای می‌مونی که یهو اومده از وسط فیلم
می‌خواد بدونه..
You're like a child who
wanders into the middle of
a movie and wants to know...

143
00:07:44,355 --> 00:07:47,824
والتر.. منظورت چیه رفیق؟
هیچ دلیلی نداره،
منظورم اینه دود
Walter, what's
the point, man?
There's no reason,
here's my point, Dude.

144
00:07:47,825 --> 00:07:49,560
هیچ دلیلی نیست
که چرا این دوتا 
There's no fucking reason
why these two...

145
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,794
آره والتر.
منظورت چیه؟
Yeah, Walter,
what's your point?

146
00:07:50,795 --> 00:07:52,896
والتر.. بابا..
Walter, what is the...

147
00:07:52,897 --> 00:07:55,399
ببین ما می‌دونیم تقصیر کی بوده الان
Look, we all know
who is at fault here.

148
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,668
پس اصن راجع‌به چی حرف می‌زنی؟
هان؟
What the fuck are
you talking about?
Huh?

149
00:07:57,669 --> 00:08:00,399
نه تو راجع به چی حرف می‌زنی؟
من ن..
No, what the fuck
are you... I'm not...

150
00:08:01,005 --> 00:08:03,407
ما داریم راجع به تهاجم مهارنشده صحبت می‌کنیم، دوود.
We're talking about
unchecked aggression
here, Dude.

151
00:08:03,408 --> 00:08:05,108
چی می‌گه این؟
قالیم.
What the fuck is
he talking about?
My rug.

152
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:06,977
ولش کن دانی. نداری فازو
Forget it, Donny!
You're out of
your element!

153
00:08:06,978 --> 00:08:09,645
والتر. این چشم‌بادومی که فرشمو کثیف کرد
Walter, the Chinaman
who peed on my rug,

154
00:08:09,646 --> 00:08:11,580
نمی‌تونم برم بهش قبض جریمه بدم که!!
I can't go
give him a bill!

155
00:08:11,581 --> 00:08:13,316
پس اصلن راجع به چی حرف می‌زنی؟
So what the fuck
are you talking about?

156
00:08:13,317 --> 00:08:14,517
تو راجع به چی حرف می‌زنی؟
What the fuck are
you talking about?

157
00:08:14,518 --> 00:08:16,752
چشم‌بادومیه اصلن موضوع بحث نیست الان، دود!
The Chinaman is not
the issue here, Dude!

158
00:08:16,753 --> 00:08:19,422
من راجع به کشیدن خط فرضی توی شن صحبت می‌کنم، دود.
I'm talking about
drawing a line in
the sand, Dude.

159
00:08:19,423 --> 00:08:21,924
روی این خط، شما ن..
Across this line
you do not...

160
00:08:21,925 --> 00:08:26,095
درضمن، دوود، «چشم بادومی» لغت پسندیده‌ای نیست.
Also, Dude, "Chinaman"
is not the preferred
nomenclature.

161
00:08:26,096 --> 00:08:27,797
آسیایی-آمریکایی، خواهشا..
Asian-American,
please.

162
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:31,300
والتر این یارو اونی نیست که راه‌آهن‌های اینجارو ساخته
این یارو..
Walter, this isn't a guy
who built the railroads
here. This is a guy...

163
00:08:31,301 --> 00:08:33,069
چی می‌گ..؟
What the fuck
are you...

164
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:36,138
والتر این یارو ریده رو فرش من.
ریده رو فرش دوود.
Walter, he peed
on my rug!
He peed on
the Dude's rug.

165
00:08:36,139 --> 00:08:37,773
دانی، هیچی نمی‌دونی حرف نزن.
Donny, you're out
of your element.

166
00:08:37,774 --> 00:08:41,143
دوود، ما اصلن راجع به چشم بادومیه صحبت نمی‌کنیم
Dude, the Chinaman
is not the issue here.

167
00:08:41,144 --> 00:08:43,646
پس، کی..
جف لبوفسکی
So, who...
Jeff Lebowski.

168
00:08:43,647 --> 00:08:46,849
اونیکی جف لبوفسکی.
اون میلیونره..
The other Jeffrey Lebowski.
The millionaire.

169
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:49,685
ایول بابا.. این شد یه چیزی..
این شد یه چیزی..
That's fucking
interesting, man.
That's fucking interesting.

170
00:08:49,686 --> 00:08:53,756
بعلاوه، این ثروتش رو هم داره،
و مشخصا منابعش رو
Plus, he has the
wealth, obviously,
and the resources,

171
00:08:53,757 --> 00:08:56,359
پس هیچ دلیلی نیست،
هیچ دلیل احمقانه‌ای نیست
so that there's no reason,
there's no fucking reason

172
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,161
که زنش بره بیرون و تو کل شهر قرض بالا بیاره
why his wife should
go out and owe money
all over town,

173
00:08:59,162 --> 00:09:01,697
بعد هم اونا هم بیان برینن رو فرش قشنگ تو
and then they come
and they pee on your
fucking rug!

174
00:09:01,698 --> 00:09:03,032
بد می‌گم؟
نه.
Am I wrong?
No.

175
00:09:03,033 --> 00:09:04,667
بد می‌گم؟
آره. ولی..
Am I wrong?
Yeah, but...

176
00:09:04,668 --> 00:09:05,801
والتر: خیل خب.
WALTER: Okay then.

177
00:09:05,802 --> 00:09:07,293
(WALTER CLEARS THROAT)

178
00:09:07,537 --> 00:09:10,640
اون فرش واقعا به اتاق انسجام می‌بخشید، مگه نه؟
That rug really tied
the room together,
did it not?

179
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,641
آهر بابا
این یارو هم شاشید روش
Fucking A.
And this guy peed on it.

180
00:09:12,642 --> 00:09:14,043
دانی. لطفا.
Donny, please.

181
00:09:14,044 --> 00:09:15,311
می‌دونی. این همون آشغالیه که
You know, this is

182
00:09:15,312 --> 00:09:17,680
اصن من میتونم این لبوفسکیه رو گیرش بیارم

183
00:09:17,681 --> 00:09:20,116

His name is Lebowski?
That's your name, Dude.

184
00:09:20,117 --> 00:09:24,486
این یارو باید خسارت منو برا فرش بده.
This is the guy who
should compensate me
for the fucking rug.

185
00:09:24,487 --> 00:09:28,189
زنش می‌ره بیرون و تو شهر بدهی میاره بالا،
اینام میان میشاشن به فرش من؟
His wife goes out and
owes money all over town,
and they pee on my rug?

186
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:30,325
اینا بیان بشاشن به فرش خوشگل تو؟
They pee on

187
00:09:30,326 --> 00:09:33,022

همینه. دوود.
Peed on my fucking rug.
That's right, Dude.

188
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:36,796

They peed on
your fucking rug.

189
00:09:38,401 --> 00:09:40,168
این هم اتاق مطالعه‌ست.
This is the study.

190
00:09:40,169 --> 00:09:42,871
همونطور که می‌بینید، انواع جوایز و افتخارات..

Oh. No, I'm not really...
Oh, please. Please.

194
00:09:53,282 --> 00:09:55,316
این کلید شهر پاسادیناست
That is the key to
the city of Pasadena,

195
00:09:55,317 --> 00:10:00,755
که آقای لبوفسکی دو سال پیش برای قدردانی از
تلاش‌هایی که برای شهر..
which Mr. Lebowski received
two years ago in recognition
of his various civic...

196
00:10:00,756 --> 00:10:05,527
اوه. این جایزه شخص موفق تجارت از اتاق بازرگانی لس آنجلس‌ه
Oh! That's the Los Angeles

Oh, not necessarily

198
00:10:07,763 --> 00:10:08,963
ئه. این..
Hey, is this...

199
00:10:08,964 --> 00:10:10,265
فقط وقتی یک فرد لایق پیدا بشه.
Given only when there's
a worthy somebody...

200
00:10:10,266 --> 00:10:11,633

بله. همینطوره. این آقای لبوفسکی هستن
با بانوی اول. درسته.
Yes, indeed,
that is Mr. Lebowski
with the first lady, yes.

202
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:16,271
این عکس زمانی گرفته شد که خانم ریگان
It was taken
when Mrs. Reagan...

203
00:10:16,272 --> 00:10:19,007
لبوفسکی این سمت چپیه‌س؟
That's Lebowski

Of course. Mr. Lebowski,

So he's a...

205
00:10:21,811 --> 00:10:24,479
می‌گم ینی معلول و ایناست؟
You know, a handicapped

206
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,642
بله. آقای لبوفسکی ناتوان هستن. درسته.
Mr. Lebowski is

207

این عکس زمانی گرفته شد که خانم ریگان بانوی اول کشور بودن.
This picture was taken

208
00:10:30,586 --> 00:10:31,753
بله. بله.
Yes, yes.

209
00:10:31,754 --> 00:10:33,788
نه کالیفرنیا.

Not of California.
Good shot.

210
00:10:33,789 --> 00:10:36,091
اتفاقا با رئیس‌جمهور هم بطور خصوصی ملاقات کردن
In fact, he met privately
with the President,

211
00:10:36,092 --> 00:10:38,926
ولی متاسفانه فرصت کافی برای گرفتن عکس نبود.
though, unfortunately,
there wasn't enough time
for a photo opportunity.

212
00:10:38,927 --> 00:10:40,961
اوه. نانسی‌م خوبه.
بله. زن فوق‌العاده‌ی هستن.
Oh, Nancy's pretty good.

These are...

214
00:10:43,331 --> 00:10:46,100

Oh, those are
Mr. Lebowski's
children, so to speak.

215
00:10:46,101 --> 00:10:47,468
مادرهاشون یکی نیست که. نه؟
Different mothers, huh?

216
00:10:47,469 --> 00:10:49,870
نه. اونا..
اون از لحاظ نژادی خیلی قوی و ایناست؟
No, they're not...
Racially, he's

217
00:10:49,871 --> 00:10:51,270
(LAUGHING)

218
00:10:51,539 --> 00:10:53,407
اونا واقعا بچه‌های ایشون نیستن.
They're not literally
his children.

219
00:10:53,408 --> 00:10:55,743
اونا لبوفسکی‌های کوچیک‌های موفق شهر هستن
They're the Little Lebowski
Urban Achievers,

220
00:10:55,744 --> 00:10:58,846
کودکان پر استعداد شهر که امکانات لازم..
inner city children
of promise, but without
the necessary means for...

221
00:10:58,847 --> 00:11:00,948
امکانات لازم برای تحصیلات عالی رو در اختیار ندارن
Necessary means for
a higher education,

222
00:11:00,949 --> 00:11:04,451
برای همینه که آقای لبوفسکی تعهد کردن که همشون رو به کالج بفرستن.
so Mr. Lebowski is
committed to sending
all of them to college.

223
00:11:04,452 --> 00:11:05,853
عذر می‌خوام.
او. عجب.
Excuse me.
Oh, geez.

224
00:11:05,854 --> 00:11:07,755
ممنون. متشکرم.
Thank you. Thank you.

225
00:11:07,756 --> 00:11:12,216
عجب. یکی دیگه نمی‌خواد ازینا بنظرت؟

Far out. Think he's got
room for one more?
One... Oh.

226
00:11:13,862 --> 00:11:15,195
شما انگار کالج نرفتین.
You never went to college.

227
00:11:15,196 --> 00:11:17,331
لطفا دست نزنید.
چرا اتفاقا. چرا. نه. رفتم.
Please, don't touch that.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
No, I did,

228
00:11:17,332 --> 00:11:19,700
ولی می‌دونی، بیشتر وقتم رو
but, you know,
I spent most of my time

229
00:11:19,701 --> 00:11:22,936
صرف بسط‌نیشنی توی ساختمونای اداری مختلف و
occupying various
administration buildings,

230
00:11:22,937 --> 00:11:24,805
کشیدن چوب تایلندی**** و
smoking a lot
of Thai stick,

231
00:11:24,806 --> 00:11:28,075
بولینگ و .... ***‌بودم.
(LAUGHING)
breaking into the ROTC
and bowling.

232
00:11:28,076 --> 00:11:30,306
راستشو بخوای برندت خیلی بخشاشو اصلن یادم‌م نمیاد.
Tell you the truth, Brandt,
I don't remember most of it.

233
00:11:33,148 --> 00:11:34,314
(SCOFFS)

234
00:11:34,315 --> 00:11:35,476
(DOOR OPENS)

235
00:11:36,117 --> 00:11:39,353
خیل‌خب قربون.
شما لبوفسکی هستی.
منم لبوفسکی‌م
Okay, sir.
You're a Lebowski,
I'm a Lebowski.

236
00:11:39,354 --> 00:11:41,188
خیلی هم خوب.
That's terrific.

237
00:11:41,189 --> 00:11:44,056
ولی من خیلی پرمشغله هستم
و حدسم اینه که شما هم همینطور هستید.
But I am very busy,
as I imagine you are.

238
00:11:45,326 --> 00:11:46,927
چه‌کار براتون می‌تونم بکنم، قربان؟
What can I do for you, sir?

239
00:11:46,928 --> 00:11:50,531

Well, sir,
it's this rug I have.

240
00:11:50,532 --> 00:11:52,632
که واقعا یه انسجامی به اتاق می‌بخشید.
It really tied
the room together.

241
00:11:52,633 --> 00:11:55,401
شما پشت تلفن به برندت گفتید. اون به من گفت.
You told Brandt
on the phone.
He told me.

242
00:11:55,402 --> 00:11:56,927

Where do I fit in?

243
00:11:57,604 --> 00:12:00,907
خب ببینید. دنبال شما می‌گشتن این دوتا.
Well, they were looking

You know, they...
I'll say it again.

245
00:12:02,976 --> 00:12:06,179
شما پشت تلفن به برندت گفتید. اونم به من گفت.
You told Brandt on the phone.
He told me.

246
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,314
می‌دونم چه اتفاقی افتاده.
البته؛ البته.
I know what happened.
Yes, yes.

247
00:12:08,315 --> 00:12:11,617
پس درجریانید قصدشون این بود رو قالی شما خرابکاری کنن؟
Oh, so you know that
they were trying to
piss on your rug.

248
00:12:11,618 --> 00:12:13,886
من قالی شما رو بولی کردم؟
Did I urinate on your rug?

249
00:12:13,887 --> 00:12:16,222
منظورتون اینه که شما شخصا اومدید و قالی منو کثیف کردید؟
You mean, did you personally
come and pee on my rug?

00:47:11,722 --> 00:47:13,823
A hundred...
Thousand. Yes.

912
00:47:13,824 --> 00:47:16,659
Bones or clams or
whatever you call them.

913
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:20,997
Yeah, but what about my...
Your rug, yes.

914
00:47:20,998 --> 00:47:23,666
Well, with that money
you can buy any
number of rugs

915
00:47:23,667 --> 00:47:26,369
that don't have sentimental
value for me.

916
00:47:26,370 --> 00:47:28,971
And I am sorry about
that crack on the jaw.

917
00:47:28,972 --> 00:47:31,507
Oh, that's fine.
That doesn't even...

918
00:47:31,508 --> 00:47:34,143
Here's the name and
number of a doctor who
will look at it for you.

919
00:47:34,144 --> 00:47:35,778
You will receive no bill.

920
00:47:35,779 --> 00:47:37,446
He's a good man
and thorough.

921
00:47:37,447 --> 00:47:39,148
(STUTTERS)
That's thoughtful but...

922
00:47:39,149 --> 00:47:42,641
Please see him, Jeffrey.
He's a good man and thorough.

923
00:47:44,253 --> 00:47:46,415
Oh, well, all right.

924
00:47:47,456 --> 00:47:49,190
So he says, "My wife's
a pain in the ass.

925
00:47:49,191 --> 00:47:51,693
"She's always busting
my frigging agates.

926
00:47:51,694 --> 00:47:54,963
"My daughter's married
to a loser bastard.

927
00:47:54,964 --> 00:47:58,933
"l got a rash
so bad on my ass
I can't even sit down.

928
00:47:58,934 --> 00:48:01,202
"But you know me,
I can't complain."

929
00:48:01,203 --> 00:48:03,071
(LAUGHING)
Oh, fucking A, man.

930
00:48:03,072 --> 00:48:05,803
I got a rash, man. Fucking A.

931
00:48:06,876 --> 00:48:09,511
I gotta tell you, Tone, man,

932
00:48:09,512 --> 00:48:12,714
earlier today I was really
feeling shitty, man.

933
00:48:12,715 --> 00:48:14,716
Really down in the dumps.

934
00:48:14,717 --> 00:48:16,184
Lost a little money...

935
00:48:16,185 --> 00:48:19,688
Hey, you know what?
Forget about it, huh?
Forget about it.

936
00:48:19,689 --> 00:48:21,022
Yeah, fuck it, man.

937
00:48:21,023 --> 00:48:23,925
You can't be worried
about that shit.
Life goes on, man.

938
00:48:23,926 --> 00:48:26,623
Well, home, sweet home,
Mr. L.

939
00:48:29,365 --> 00:48:31,733
TONY: Hey, yo. Come here.

940
00:48:31,734 --> 00:48:34,226
Who's your friend
in the Volkswagen?
Huh?

941
00:48:36,105 --> 00:48:38,406
TONY: Yeah.
He followed us here.

942
00:48:38,407 --> 00:48:41,409
When did he start...
Whoa! What the fuck?

943
00:48:41,410 --> 00:48:43,611
Get in the limo,
you son of a bitch!
No arguments!

944
00:48:43,612 --> 00:48:46,480
Hey! Hey! Careful, man!
There's a beverage here!

945
00:48:48,150 --> 00:48:50,685
Start talking,
and talk fast,
you lousy bum.

946
00:48:50,686 --> 00:48:52,620
We've been frantically
trying to reach you, Dude.

947
00:48:52,621 --> 00:48:55,147
Where is my goddamn money,
you bum?

948
00:48:56,691 --> 00:48:59,493
Well, we... I don't...

949
00:48:59,494 --> 00:49:01,862
They did not receive
the money, you nitwit!

950
00:49:01,863 --> 00:49:03,564
They did not
receive the money!

951
00:49:03,565 --> 00:49:05,933
Her life was
in your hands!

952
00:49:05,934 --> 00:49:07,534
This is our concern, Dude.

953
00:49:07,535 --> 00:49:09,670
No, man.
Nothing is fucked here.

954
00:49:09,671 --> 00:49:11,672
Nothing is fucked?
No, man.

955
00:49:11,673 --> 00:49:15,576
The goddamn plane
has crashed into
the mountain!

956
00:49:15,577 --> 00:49:19,880
Man, come on.
Who are you gonna
believe, those guys or...

957
00:49:19,881 --> 00:49:21,715
We dropped off the damn money.

958
00:49:21,716 --> 00:49:23,013
We?

959
00:49:24,319 --> 00:49:27,388
l, the royal we.

960
00:49:27,389 --> 00:49:28,822
You know. The editorial...

961
00:49:28,823 --> 00:49:30,958
I dropped off the money
exactly as per...

962
00:49:30,959 --> 00:49:34,828
Look, man, I've got
certain information.
All right?

963
00:49:34,829 --> 00:49:37,398
Certain things have
come to light and...

964
00:49:37,399 --> 00:49:40,100
You know, has it ever
occurred to you

965
00:49:40,101 --> 00:49:45,639
that instead of, you know,
running around, blaming me...

966
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:47,908
You know, given the nature
of all this new shit,

967
00:49:47,909 --> 00:49:53,847
you know, this could be
a lot more complex...

968
00:49:53,848 --> 00:49:58,886
I mean, it's not just...
It might not be just such
a simple... You know?

969
00:49:58,887 --> 00:50:02,489
What in God's holy name
are you blathering about?

970
00:50:02,490 --> 00:50:04,925
Well, I'll tell you what
I'm blathering about.

971
00:50:04,926 --> 00:50:06,960
I've got information, man.

972
00:50:06,961 --> 00:50:08,796
New shit has come to light.

973
00:50:08,797 --> 00:50:10,764
And, shit, man,

974
00:50:12,733 --> 00:50:14,633
she kidnapped herself.

975
00:50:17,671 --> 00:50:20,473
Well, sure, man.
Look at it. You know?

976
00:50:20,474 --> 00:50:24,510
A young trophy wife,
in the parlance of
our times, you know.

977
00:50:24,511 --> 00:50:29,677
She owes money
all over town, including
to known pornographers.

978
00:50:31,585 --> 00:50:33,849
And that's cool.
That's cool.

979
00:50:34,721 --> 00:50:38,624
I'm saying she
needs money, man.

980
00:50:38,625 --> 00:50:42,289
And, you know,
of course they're gonna
say they didn't get it

981
00:50:43,597 --> 00:50:46,499
because she wants more, man.

982
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:48,935
She's gotta feed the monkey.
I mean...

983
00:50:51,271 --> 00:50:54,440
Hasn't that ever
occurred to you, man?

984
00:50:54,441 --> 00:50:55,499
Sir?

985
00:50:57,678 --> 00:51:01,147
No, Mr. Lebowski,
it had not occurred
to me.

986
00:51:01,148 --> 00:51:03,449
That had not
occurred to us, Dude.

987
00:51:03,450 --> 00:51:04,984
Well, okay, you know?

988
00:51:04,985 --> 00:51:09,589
You guys aren't privy
to all the new shit,
so, you know...

989
00:51:09,590 --> 00:51:13,059
But, hey, that's what you...
That's what you pay me for.

990
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:14,186
(CHUCKLES)

991
00:51:15,395 --> 00:51:16,596
Speaking of which,

992
00:51:16,597 --> 00:51:21,000
do you think that you could
give me my $20,000 in cash?

993
00:51:21,001 --> 00:51:24,070
My concern is, and
I've gotta check it
with my accountant,

994
00:51:24,071 --> 00:51:26,872
that this might bump me up
into a higher tax...

995
00:51:26,873 --> 00:51:29,467
Brandt, give him
the envelope.

996
00:51:30,176 --> 00:51:34,246
Oh, well, if you've
already got the check
made out, that's cool.

997
00:51:34,247 --> 00:51:36,238
BRANDT: We received this
this morning.

998
00:51:38,784 --> 00:51:42,254
Since you have
failed to achieve,

999
00:51:42,255 --> 00:51:45,824
even in the modest task
which was your charge,

1000
00:51:45,825 --> 00:51:49,094
since you have
stolen my money,

1001
00:51:49,095 --> 00:51:52,864
since you have
unrepentantly
betrayed my trust,

1002
00:51:52,865 --> 00:51:56,902
I have no choice
but to tell these bums

1003
00:51:56,903 --> 00:51:59,204
to do whatever is necessary

1004
00:51:59,205 --> 00:52:03,335
to recover their money
from you, Jeffrey Lebowski.

1005
00:52:04,610 --> 00:52:08,747
And with Brandt as my witness,
I will tell you this,

1006
00:52:08,748 --> 00:52:12,117
any further harm
visited upon Bunny

1007
00:52:12,118 --> 00:52:15,713
will be visited tenfold
upon your head.

1008
00:52:18,124 --> 00:52:19,557
By God, sir,

1009
00:52:20,092 --> 00:52:23,085
I will not abide another toe.

1010
00:52:23,729 --> 00:52:29,200
I hear the cottonwoods
whispering above

1011
00:52:29,201 --> 00:52:31,329
بابا انگشت خودش که نبوده دوود.
That wasn't her toe, Dude.

1012
00:52:33,072 --> 00:52:36,207
انگشت کی بوده پس والتر؟
من از کجا بدونم؟
Whose toe was it, Walter?
How the fuck should I know?

1013
00:52:36,208 --> 00:52:39,777
فقط می‌دونم هیچی بر این دلالت نمی‌کنه که
I do know that nothing
about it indicates...
لاک ناخنش، والتر.
The nail polish, Walter.

1014
00:52:39,778 --> 00:52:41,178

Fine, Dude

1015
00:52:41,179 --> 00:52:45,149
انگار مثلا نمیشه یه لاک ناخن بگیری، بزنی رو انگشت یکی دیگه..
As if it's impossible to get
some nail polish, apply it
to someone else's toe...

1016

آره، ولی والتر
You don't wanna know
about it, believe me.
Yeah, but, Walter...

1021
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:58,662
جهنم. اصن می‌تونم تا ۳ بعد از ظهر برات یک انگشت گیر بیارم.

Hell, I could get you a toe
by 3:00 this afternoon
with nail polish.

ما قراره از ترس برینیم تو شلوارمون.

ourselves with fear.

kill her, Walter,

1026

و بعدش قراره منو بکشن..

01:39:17,936 --> 01:39:21,405
Whereas this
whole fucking thing,
this whole fucking thing

1779
01:39:21,406 --> 01:39:24,342
is nothing about nothing,
about oil,

1780
01:39:24,343 --> 01:39:26,777
which is what I personally
hear, Dude.

1781
01:39:26,778 --> 01:39:29,146
Sure you'll see
some tank battles,

1782
01:39:29,147 --> 01:39:32,674
but fighting in desert
is very different from
fighting in canopy jungle.

1783
01:39:33,752 --> 01:39:37,188
I mean, Nam was
a foot soldier's war,
whereas this thing should...

1784
01:39:38,155 --> 01:39:40,490
You know, should be
a piece of cake.

1785
01:39:40,491 --> 01:39:44,027
I mean, I had an M16, Jacko,
not an Abrams fucking tank.

1786
01:39:44,028 --> 01:39:47,497
Me and Charlie,
eyeball to eyeball.
Yeah.

1787
01:39:47,498 --> 01:39:49,899
That's fucking combat.

1788
01:39:49,900 --> 01:39:52,869
The man in the black
pajamas, Dude.

1789
01:39:52,870 --> 01:39:54,838
Worthy fucking adversary.

1790
01:39:54,839 --> 01:39:58,341
Who's in pajamas, Walter?
Shut the fuck up, Donny.

1791
01:39:58,342 --> 01:40:00,643
Whereas what we have here,

1792
01:40:00,644 --> 01:40:02,879
a bunch of fig eaters
wearing towels
on their head,

1793
01:40:02,880 --> 01:40:05,042
trying to find reverse
on a Soviet tank.

1794
01:40:05,916 --> 01:40:08,184
This is not a worthy
fucking adversary.
QUINTANA: Hey!

1795
01:40:08,185 --> 01:40:10,286
What's this
day-of-rest shit?

1796
01:40:10,287 --> 01:40:11,955
What's this bullshit?

1797
01:40:11,956 --> 01:40:15,091
I don't fucking care!
It don't matter to Jesus.

1798
01:40:15,092 --> 01:40:16,626
But you not fooling me,
man.

1799
01:40:16,627 --> 01:40:19,429
You might fool the fucks
in the league office

1800
01:40:19,430 --> 01:40:21,728
but you don't fool Jesus.

1801
01:40:21,899 --> 01:40:24,701
It's Bush league
psych-out stuff.

1802
01:40:24,702 --> 01:40:26,101
Laughable, man!

1803
01:40:27,271 --> 01:40:30,366
I would've fucked you
in the ass Saturday.

1804
01:40:31,108 --> 01:40:34,044
I'll fuck you in the ass
next Wednesday instead.

1806
01:40:35,513 --> 01:40:37,947
You got a date
Wednesday, baby!

1807
01:40:42,820 --> 01:40:44,087
He's cracking.

1808
01:40:44,088 --> 01:40:45,889
...the whole concept of age.

1809
01:40:45,890 --> 01:40:48,158
I mean, many learned men
have disputed this

1810
01:40:48,159 --> 01:40:51,026
but in the 14th century,
the Rambam...

1811
01:41:01,037 --> 01:41:03,305
Well, they finally
did it.

1812
01:41:03,306 --> 01:41:05,541
They killed
my fucking car.

1813
01:41:05,542 --> 01:41:09,178
We want the money,
Lebowski.

1814
01:41:09,179 --> 01:41:11,780
Ja. Otherwise,
we kill the girl.

1815
01:41:11,781 --> 01:41:15,384
Ja. It seems you have
forgotten our little deal,
Lebowski.

1816
01:41:15,385 --> 01:41:18,220
You don't have the
fucking girl, dipshit.

1817
01:41:18,221 --> 01:41:20,522
We know you never did.

1818
01:41:20,523 --> 01:41:22,191
Are these the Nazis,
Walter?

1819
01:41:22,192 --> 01:41:23,992
No, Donny.
These men are nihilists.

1820
01:41:23,993 --> 01:41:25,427
There's nothing
to be afraid of.

1821
01:41:27,096 --> 01:41:28,263
We don't care.

1822
01:41:28,264 --> 01:41:32,801
We still want the money,
Lebowski, or we fuck you up.

1823
01:41:32,802 --> 01:41:35,537
Fuck you.
Fuck the three of you.
Cool it, Walter.

1824
01:41:35,538 --> 01:41:39,475
No. Without a hostage,
there is no ransom.

1825
01:41:39,476 --> 01:41:42,911
That's what ransom is.
Those are the fucking rules.

1826
01:41:42,912 --> 01:41:45,314
His girlfriend
gave up her toe.

1827
01:41:45,315 --> 01:41:47,716
She thought we could
get $1 million.

1828
01:41:47,717 --> 01:41:50,319
It's not fair.
Fair?

1829
01:41:50,320 --> 01:41:54,022
Who's the fucking nihilists
around here, you bunch
of fucking crybabies?

1830
01:41:54,023 --> 01:41:56,492
Cool it, Walter.
Hey, look, pal.

1831
01:41:56,493 --> 01:41:58,293
DUDE: There never
was any money.

1832
01:41:58,294 --> 01:42:00,496
The big Lebowski gave me
an empty briefcase,

1833
01:42:00,497 --> 01:42:02,631
so take it up with him, man.

1834
01:42:02,632 --> 01:42:05,234
And I would like
my undies back.

1835
01:42:05,235 --> 01:42:06,534
Are these guys gonna
hurt us, Walter?

1836
01:42:06,535 --> 01:42:09,103
No, Donny.
These men are cowards.

1837
01:42:09,104 --> 01:42:10,471
Okay!

1838
01:42:10,472 --> 01:42:13,999
So we takes the money
you have on you, and
we calls it even.

1839
01:42:15,444 --> 01:42:17,545

Hey, no. Come on, Walter.

1840
01:42:17,546 --> 01:42:19,647
Come on, we're ending
this thing cheap, man.

1841
01:42:19,648 --> 01:42:22,316
No. What's mine is mine.
No, come on, Walter.

1842
01:42:22,317 --> 01:42:24,619
No funny stuff.
All right. All right.

1843
01:42:24,620 --> 01:42:29,457
No funny stuff.
I got 4 bucks, almost 5.

I got $1·.
WALTER: What's mine is mine.

Are you shot, Donny?

There weren't
any shots fired.

It's a heart attack.

I'd go myself,
but I'm pumping blood,
might pass out.

$1·0?

He was one of us.

1909

He was a man who loved
the outdoors and bowling.

he explored the beaches

you took him,

as you took so many bright,

Oh, shit, Dude. I'm sorry.

1932
01:48:10,528 --> 01:48:13,730
Goddamn wind.
Fuck, god damn it, Walter!

1933
01:48:13,731 --> 01:48:16,099
You fucking asshole!
Shit, Dude. I'm sorry.

1934
01:48:16,100 --> 01:48:18,400
Everything's a fucking
travesty with you, man!

1935
01:48:18,401 --> 01:48:20,069
I'm sorry.
It was an accident.

1936
01:48:20,070 --> 01:48:22,638
What was that shit
about Vietnam?
Dude, I'm sorry.

1937
01:48:22,639 --> 01:48:25,040
What the fuck does anything
have to do with Vietnam?

1938
01:48:25,041 --> 01:48:27,109
Dude, I'm sorry.
What the fuck are
you talking about?

1939
01:48:27,110 --> 01:48:28,703
Dude, I'm sorry.

1940
01:48:31,615 --> 01:48:32,843
Fucking...

1941
01:48:39,823 --> 01:48:41,291
Fuck, Walter.

1942
01:48:43,193 --> 01:48:44,683
Come on, Dude.

1943
01:48:45,528 --> 01:48:47,190
Hey, fuck it, man.

1944
01:48:51,101 --> 01:48:52,728
Let's go bowling.

1945
01:49:16,226 --> 01:49:19,525
And when you're sittin' there

1946
01:49:20,163 --> 01:49:23,292
In your silk upholstered chair

1947
01:49:24,801 --> 01:49:28,829
Talkin' to some rich folks
that you know

1948
01:49:32,174 --> 01:49:35,007
Well, I hope you don't see me

1949
01:49:36,011 --> 01:49:39,243
In my ragged company

1950
01:49:40,015 --> 01:49:45,078
O£, but you know
I could never be alone

1951
01:49:47,256 --> 01:49:50,325
Two oat sodas, Gary.
Right. Good luck tomorrow.

1952
01:49:50,326 --> 01:49:53,861
Yeah, thanks, man.
I was sorry
to hear about Donny.

1953
01:49:53,862 --> 01:49:56,730
Oh, yeah. Well, you know,

1954
01:49:57,566 --> 01:50:01,636
sometimes you eat the bear,
and sometimes, you know...

1955
01:50:01,637 --> 01:50:02,900
Hey, man.

1956
01:50:03,706 --> 01:50:06,975
How do you do, Dude?
I wondered if
I'd see you again.

1957
01:50:06,976 --> 01:50:09,110
I wouldn't miss
the semis.

1958
01:50:09,111 --> 01:50:10,812
Oh, yeah?
How's things been going?

1959
01:50:10,813 --> 01:50:14,015
Well, you know,
strikes and gutters,
ups and downs.

1960
01:50:14,016 --> 01:50:16,712
Sure. I got you.
Yeah.

1961
01:50:18,287 --> 01:50:19,387
Thanks, Gary.

1962
01:50:19,388 --> 01:50:21,823
Well, take care, man.
Gotta get back.

1963
01:50:21,824 --> 01:50:24,959
Sure. Take it easy, Dude.
Oh, yeah.

1964
01:50:24,960 --> 01:50:27,128
I know that you will.

1965
01:50:27,129 --> 01:50:30,463
Yeah. Well,
the Dude abides.

1966
01:50:34,470 --> 01:50:35,664
Walter.

1967
01:50:37,373 --> 01:50:39,341
The Dude abides.

1968
01:50:43,245 --> 01:50:46,578
I don't know about you,
but I take comfort in that.

1969
01:50:47,882 --> 01:50:50,183
It's good knowing
he's out there,

1970
01:50:50,184 --> 01:50:54,246
the Dude, taking her easy
for all us sinners.

1971
01:50:56,991 --> 01:50:59,153
I sure hope
he makes the finals.

1972
01:51:00,762 --> 01:51:02,963
Well, that about does her.

1973
01:51:02,964 --> 01:51:04,454
Wraps her all up.

1974
01:51:06,067 --> 01:51:09,526
Things seem to have
worked out pretty good
for the Dude and Walter.

1975
01:51:10,204 --> 01:51:13,470
And it was
a pretty good story,
don't you think?

1976
01:51:14,342 --> 01:51:16,674
Made me laugh
to beat the band.

1977
01:51:17,311 --> 01:51:18,779
Parts anyway.

1978
01:51:20,348 --> 01:51:22,510
I didn't like seeing Donny go.

1979
01:51:23,618 --> 01:51:28,647
But then I happen to know
that there's a little
Lebowski on the way.

1980
01:51:30,324 --> 01:51:33,658
I guess that's the way
the whole darned
human comedy keeps

1981
01:51:34,228 --> 01:51:36,630
perpetuating itself

1982
01:51:36,631 --> 01:51:38,793
down through the generations.

1983
01:51:39,300 --> 01:51:43,567
Westward the wagons,
across the sands of time
until we...

1984
01:51:44,772 --> 01:51:47,969
Oh, look at me.
I'm rambling again.

1985
01:51:49,377 --> 01:51:51,869
Well, I hope you folks
enjoyed yourselves.

1986
01:51:52,346 --> 01:51:54,679
Catch you later on
down the trail.

1987
01:51:55,883 --> 01:51:58,978
Say, friend, you got any more
of that good sarsaparilla?

1988
01:52:21,942 --> 01:52:26,011
Take me down, little Susie

1989
01:52:26,012 --> 01:52:27,844
Take me down

1990
01:52:31,151 --> 01:52:33,752
I know you think
you're the queen

1991
01:52:33,753 --> 01:52:35,847
Of the underground

1992
01:52:39,559 --> 01:52:44,520
Send me dead flowers
every morning

1993
01:52:47,901 --> 01:52:52,429
Send me dead flowers
by the mail

1994
01:52:56,209 --> 01:53:00,669
Send me dead flowers
to my wedding

1995
01:53:03,216 --> 01:53:10,384
And I won't forget to put
roses on your grave

1996
01:53:11,491 --> 01:53:15,894
No, I won't forget
to put roses

1997
01:53:15,895 --> 01:53:20,195
On your grave

1998
01:53:24,670 --> 01:53:26,968
(POP MUSIC PLAYING)

1999
01:53:45,324 --> 01:53:49,852
Bright light city
gonna set my soul

2000
01:53:50,329 --> 01:53:54,027
Gonna set my soul on fire

2001
01:53:55,367 --> 01:54:00,572
Got a whole lot of money
that's ready to burn

2002
01:54:00,573 --> 01:54:04,202
So get those stakes up higher

2003
01:54:05,778 --> 01:54:10,545
There's a thousand pretty
women livin' out there

2004
01:54:11,283 --> 01:54:16,454
They're all livin'
devil may care

2005
01:54:16,455 --> 01:54:21,025
And I'm just a devil
with love to spare

2006
01:54:21,026 --> 01:54:25,259
So viva Las Vegas

2007
01:54:26,799 --> 01:54:30,860
Viva Las Vegas

2008
01:54:34,572 --> 01:54:39,309
Viva Las Vegas
with your neon flashing

2009
01:54:39,310 --> 01:54:42,346
And your one-arm
bandits crashing

2010
01:54:42,347 --> 01:54:45,942
All those hopes down the drain

2011
01:54:47,518 --> 01:54:52,789
Viva Las Vegas turnin'
day into nighttime

2012
01:54:52,790 --> 01:54:55,359
Night into daytime

2013
01:54:55,360 --> 01:54:57,628
If you see it once

2014
01:54:57,629 --> 01:55:04,034
You'll never be the same again

2015
01:55:06,104 --> 01:55:10,641
I'm gonna keep on
keep on runnin'

2016
01:55:10,642 --> 01:55:14,373
If it costs me
my very last dime

2017
01:55:15,913 --> 01:55:18,315
If I wind up broke

2018
01:55:18,316 --> 01:55:20,617
Well, I'll always remember

2019
01:55:20,618 --> 01:55:24,646
That I had a swingin' time

2020
01:55:26,491 --> 01:55:30,587
I'm gonna give it
everything I've got

2021
01:55:31,696 --> 01:55:35,928
Lady Luck, please
let the dice stay hot

2022
01:55:36,868 --> 01:55:41,471
£et me shoot a seven
on every shot

2023
01:55:41,472 --> 01:55:45,670
